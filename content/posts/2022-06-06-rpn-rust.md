+++ 

Since I'm now a [Rust][rust] developer by day, I'm trying to flatten my learning curve by using Rust for pet/learning projects. Trying to pick a task small enough to learn and looking for a calculator that is usable _directly_ from the command-line, I didn't find anything I liked that was really simple. I'm aware of calculators like [bc(1)][bc], [dc(1)][dc], [kalker][kalker] and of course [calc in Emacs][calc]. All of these are extraordinary in their own right. For any extensive calculations and/or statistics there is of course [Julia][julia] and [R][rproject]. What I wanted was something simple that allows one to type simple expressions directly in the shell without the need for quoting or escaping of special characters. Hence [rpn][rpn].

## The start

Because Rust has support for [ADT][adt]'s via `enum`s [see][enums] the [Enums and Pattern Matching][enums] section in the [Rust book][rbook] for an introduction, handling a combination of integer and floating point arithmetic can be implemented with little effort. The first type written down looks like this:

~~~ rust
enum Num {
    Integer(i64),
    Float(f64, usize),
}
~~~ 

The second value associated with the `Float` variant, is used to track the [number of signicant figures][sigf]. The possibility of an _item_ being either a number or an operator is represented by the `Item` `enum`:

~~~ rs
enum Item {
    Operand(Num),
    Operator(Oper),
}
~~~

Implementing the arithmetic was simply forwarding the hard work to the appropriate Rust standard library function. With a few [macro's][macro] to implement the necessary traits progress was nice. As an example here is the implementation of the binary operator trait:

~~~ rs
trait BinaryOperator: Display {
    fn apply(&self, lhs: Num, rhs: Num) -> Num;
}

macro_rules! impl_bin_op {
    ($oper:ident, $native_op:path) => {
        impl BinaryOperator for $oper {
            fn apply(&self, lhs: Num, rhs: Num) -> Num {
                match (lhs, rhs) {
                    (Num::Integer(l), Num::Integer(r)) => Num::Integer($native_op(l, r)),
                    (Num::Float(l, prec), Num::Integer(r)) => {
                        Num::Float($native_op(l, r as f64), prec)
                    }
                    (Num::Integer(l), Num::Float(r, prec)) => {
                        Num::Float($native_op(l as f64, r), prec)
                    }
                    (Num::Float(l, lprec), Num::Float(r, rprec)) => {
                        Num::Float($native_op(l, r), min(lprec, rprec))
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    };
}

struct Add;
impl_bin_op!(Add, std::ops::Add::add);
~~~

Because the standard arithmetic operations are implemented is functions in the standard library these can be used here as the  `$native_op` function.

## The middle

The parsing of the expressions, if one could call it that because all that is really happening is tokenizing. Is split into three [`FromStr`][fromstr] implementations. The first one of the `Item` `enum`:


~~~  rs
impl FromStr for Item {
    type Err = String;

    fn from_str(s: &str) -> Result<Self, Self::Err> {
        s.parse::<Num>().map_or_else(
            |err_1| s.parse::<Oper>().map_or_else(
            |err_2| Err(format!("could not parse '{s}' as either a number or operator; {err_1}; {err_2}")),
            |o| Ok(Self::Operator(o))),
            |n| Ok(Self::Operand(n)))
    }
}
~~~

The second one is the implementation for `Num`:

~~~ rs
impl FromStr for Num {
    type Err = String;

    fn from_str(s: &str) -> Result<Self, Self::Err> {
        if PI_TOKEN == s {
            return Ok(PI);
        }
        s.parse::<i64>().map_or_else(
                |err_1| {
            let prec = s
                .chars()
                .take_while(|c| *c != 'e' || *c != 'E')
                .filter(|c| char::is_digit(*c, 10))
                .count();
            s.parse::<f64>().map_or_else(
                |err_2| {
                    Err(format!(
                        "could not parse as floating point or integer number '{s}'; {err_1}; {err_2}"
                    ))
                },
                |f| Ok(Self::Float(f, prec)),
            )
                },
                |i| Ok(Self::Integer(i)),
            )
    }
}

~~~

Here we see the nice _high-level_ method chains that can be written in Rust, in this case to calculate the number of significant figures eluded to earlier.

The `FromStr` implementation, is a big switch statement looking something like:

~~~ rs

impl FromStr for Oper {
    type Err = String;

    fn from_str(s: &str) -> Result<Self, Self::Err> {
        match s {
            "+" => Ok(Self::Bin(BinOp {
                oper: Box::new(Add),
            })),
            "-" => Ok(Self::Bin(BinOp {
                oper: Box::new(Sub),
            })),
            "x" => Ok(Self::Bin(BinOp {
                oper: Box::new(Mult),
            })),
            â‹® 
            })),
            "..=" => Ok(Self::Range(RangeOp {
                oper: Box::new(RangeInc),
            })),
            bad => Err(format!("not a valid operator '{bad}'")),
        }
    }
}

~~~

The `main` function takes in all arguments splits them on whitespace and call's `.parse::<Item>()`.

The evaluator takes the `Item`'s and performs the operations by manipulating the stack as one would expect. Using the mentioned macro's this calculator was implemented in 480 lines of code, excluding the tests. 

### Conclusion

It was fun to work on this tiny side-project, it learned me a great deal especially about [traits][traits] and the differences between [`iter()`][iter] and [`into_iter()`][intoiter].
