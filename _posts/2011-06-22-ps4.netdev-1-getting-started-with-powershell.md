After getting everybody warmed to the idea of learning [PowerShell][1]
in [part 0][0] of this [series][12]. Let's dig into a couple of ways
to get started with [PowerShell][1].

## The resource list
By now [PowerShell][1] has gained so much traction at this moment that
I could probably fill several dozen pages with links, pointers to the
excellent resources available on-line or in print. However I will
refrain myself to a couple starting points.

### On-line resources
- [PowerShell Community Toolbar][2]
  This is a browser plug-in that aggregates a big set of resources,
  from download links to the various [PowerShell][1] releases to a
  huge list of blogs filled with [PowerShell][1] content, to the
  localized [PowerShell][1] on-line help. Even if you are not very
  fond of browser toolbars I suggest you install it, take some time to
  follow the various links save them and uninstall the toolbar.
- [ScriptCenter PowerShell homepage][1] this contains loads of
  resources to get you started and should be considered the canonical
  starting point for finding [PowerShell][1] related resources. 
- [Windows PowerShell Survival guide][5]
  A large list of resources to get you started, compiled by the community.
- [PowerScripting podcast][4]
  If you have some time during you commute or any other activity that
  allows you to listen to some audio I highly recommend this show. The
  show notes are of a great quality, and contain lots of links to
  learning resources. The first shows take you step
  by step through the process of learning [PowerShell][1]. 

### (e-)Books

- [Effective Windows PowerShell][7]
  A great set of tips, explanations to be as the title suggests
  effective with [PowerShell][1].
- [Master-PowerShell][6]
  A very comprehensive free e-book starting with the basics and ending
  with a guide to remoting.   
- [Windows PowerShell in Action, Second Edition][3]
  This is in my opinion the [PowerShell][1] book available today that
  is the best suited for developers. It goes into all the details of
  the language and is very well written. Be sure to get the (recently)
  released second edition, since it is filled with loads of extra
  content covering the [PowerShell][1] version 2 features.


## Just use PowerShell instead of cmd
When learning something new it is always nice to be able to start with
something familiar. The beauty of [PowerShell][1] is that all your
previous knowledge about your favorite command-line tools are not
lost. [PowerShell][1] is a shell which means you can use it to start
any of tool you used to start in cmd. Moreover the [PowerShell][1]
team has incorporated a large number of [aliases][8] that should be
familiar to you whether you are coming from a linux or cmd background
the commands you know like `dir`, `ls`, `cd`, `del`, `rm` all work as you
would expect. These aliases are also very handy for those who don't
like to type long commands at the prompt. To get an idea of what
aliases are available try the following:

<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: ps"><![CDATA[
PS> dir alias: | Out-Host -Paging
]]>
</script>

Using [PowerShell][1] as your preferred shell gives you the
opportunity to gradually learn [PowerShell][1] and just
lookup/research stuff as you use it in your day to day work.

## The 3 amigo's of discovery 
When learning [PowerShell][1] I've found that the most helpful and
best [Cmdlets][9] are the following three.

### Get-Help
[`Get-Help`][10] does exactly what you would expect especially when you know
it's aliases: `man`, `help`. You can get the help on help by typing `help`
at the prompt. This shows you how you can use [`Get-Help`][10]. Note
that [PowerShell][1] also comes with topical help pages that start
with `about_` to get an overview of the available topics type: 

<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: ps"><![CDATA[
PS> help about_*
]]>
</script>
 at the [PowerShell][1] prompt.

### Get-Command
[`Get-Command`][11] provides a way to search for a Cmdlet you would
like to use. Looking at the output of `help Get-Command` or shorter
`Get-Command -?` you will see that one of the parameter sets contain
the `-Noun` and `-Verb` parameters. The naming convention used for
Cmdlets is `<Verb>-<Noun>` this makes remembering and searching the
Cmdlets a lot easier. Say for instance I would like to know all
Cmdlets that remove stuff then 

<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: ps"><![CDATA[
PS> Get-Command -Verb remove
]]>
</script>
will list them nicely. If I would like to know what Cmdlets are available for
working with computer objects, I would type: 
<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: ps"><![CDATA[
PS> Get-Command -Noun Computer
]]>
</script> 

### Get-Member
[`Get-Member`][13] list all member that is public methods and properties
of the object passed to it. This ideal for finding what information
can be extracted from an object, what you can do with a specific
object respectively. To for instance lookup what properties you could
use on a file to sort in a directory listing you could type 

<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: ps"><![CDATA[
PS> dir | Get-Member
]]>
</script>
Or if you don't want to wait on a slowly loading MSDN page to lookup
what methods are available to you on a [`TimeSpan`][14] object you
could use something like:

<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: ps"><![CDATA[
PS> New-Object TimeSpan | Get-Member 
]]>
</script>

Or if you can't remember the way `SubString` works type:

<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: ps"><![CDATA[
PS> ""| gm
]]>
</script>
where `gm` is the (shorter) alias for [`Get-Member`][13].

I hope this provides enough pointers to guide you through your first
steps to [PowerShell][1] mastery. Check back soon for part 2 of
[this series][12] when we dive in to the [PowerShell][1] language as
viewed through the eyes of a C# developer.
