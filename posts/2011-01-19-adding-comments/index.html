implemented was a comments facility. Searching through the web I
found two options <a href=http://disqus.com/ title=Disqus>Disqus</a> and <a href=http://intensedebate.com/ title=IntenseDebate>IntenseDebate</a>. Browsing
through their respective sites, I liked <a href=http://disqus.com/ title=Disqus>Disqus</a> better.
Judging by a few comparisons I found <a href=http://geeklad.com/disqus-vs-intense-debate title="Disqus vs. Intensdebate">here</a> and <a href=http://spicycauldron.com/2009/07/06/disqus-vs-intensedebate/ title="Disqus vs. Intensdebate">here</a>,
and the fact that <a href=http://gitready.com/ title=gitready>gitready</a> uses <a href=http://disqus.com/ title=Disqus>Disqus</a>.
<a href=http://disqus.com/ title=Disqus>Disqus</a> scored best in my comparison. Their registration
process also was a lot less labor intensive. Adding the code to the
site was also trivial. Being a bit overly purist I decided to
translate the code snippet provided by <a href=http://disqus.com/ title=Disqus>Disqus</a> to
<a href=http://haml-lang.com/ title=Haml>Haml</a>. Which results in the following:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>{% assign post_id = &#39;{{ post.id }}&#39; %}
{% assign post_url = &#39;{{ post.url}}&#39; %}
</code></pre><pre tabindex=0><code>%div#disqus_thread
